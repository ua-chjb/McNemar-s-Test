# McNemar-s-Test
How to perform McNemar's Test on boolean variables

This method is a statistical t-test; H0 is that the two sampling distributions are the same and H1 is that the two sampling distributions are different. Alpha is set. With McNemar's Test, we see that the difference between the two sampling distributions was statstically significant, and so rejected H0 in favor of H1.
