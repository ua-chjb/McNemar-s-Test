# McNemar-s-Test
Testing for statistical significance with boolean variables

This method is based on the statistical t-test; H0 is that the two sampling distributions are the same and H1 is that the two sampling distributions are different. Alpha is set at 0.05. Because the variable in question is boolean in nature, the traditional t test does not apply; with McNemar's Test, we can investigate the statistical significance of this variable even with its boolean nature. The test concludes that the difference between the two sampling distributions is statstically significant, and so we reject H0 in favor of H1.
